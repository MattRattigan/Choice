# Food Choice App

A new Flutter project by software engeering students built to help people with deciding what kind of food take out they want to eat.

What is your favorite food? 
What did you eat last night?
Do you have any alergies?

After answering the three questions you are presented with a list of 10 places near you as suggestions to eat at. If you are still having issues making a choice then you can move those options to a roulette wheel that will populate with those options and spin to finally land on one option for you.
